## Digital Clock with Seven Segment Style Display 

This is my personal project which started from the scratch. The project 
will display a Digital Clock with Seven Segments style display. I have 
been using CSS-3 functions such as Flex, Grid, ClipPath and ES-6 JavaScript. 
The project took me around 7 hours.
